# Jagex_Programming_Test_SamRyle
My script for the Jagex Junior Tools Programming Job, Programming Test 
Please start by reading the Calculator.pdf file, it explains assigned task
After that read the attacked Jagex Programming Test Doc pdf it explains my workings, and shows how my code changed as I answered each question
To get the code working for yourself please replace the filepath on line 10 with the correct filepath on your local machine to the tests.txt file located in this repository
Feel free to add more formatted lines into the tests.txt file to test the code
I have left in my testing and debugging code as comments to show my work, delete as necessary
